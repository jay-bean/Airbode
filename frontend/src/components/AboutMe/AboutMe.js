    <h2>Thank you for viewing my site!</h2>
    <p>This is my first solo project. I put a lot of work into it and I hope you enjoyed it. I learned a lot, debugged even more, and had a lot of fun along the way! Learning React and Redux was a slow start for me, but this project really helped with my understanding. Such as, using React components to set the flow of the site, and using the Redux store to maintain state. I also got to play with external libraries to add some flare to my site such as react-dates DateRangePicker for my reservations, and Multer to allow users to upload images.</p>
